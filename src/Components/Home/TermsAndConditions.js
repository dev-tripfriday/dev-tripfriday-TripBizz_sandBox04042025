          When a booking is made, the 'lead name' on the booking guarantees that
          he or she has the authority to accept and does accept on behalf of the
          party the terms of these booking conditions. After we receive your
          booking and all appropriate payments, if the arrangements you wish to
          book are available, we will issue a confirmation invoice. A binding
          agreement will come into existence between us when we dispatch this
          invoice to the 'lead name' or your Tour Operator / Travel Agent. This
          contract is governed by the Courts of Law in India. It is important to
          check the details on your invoice when you get it, or if booking late
          at the time of booking, that all the details are exactly as you
          requested. In the event of any discrepancy, please contact us or your
          Tour Operator / Travel Agent immediately as it may not be possible to
          make changes later.

          Although TripBizz makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of the
          website information and pricing, regrettably errors do occasionally

          necessary travel and health documents before departure. A full and
          valid passport is required for destinations we feature (including
          children) and Visas may be required for overseas destinations.
          Requirements may change and you must check the up to date position in
          good time before departure. By availing our services, you agree that
          TripBizz can only help you apply for the visa and is not responsible
          for any issues that may occur during this application including, but

        <div className="tandc-sub-text">
          In order to confirm your chosen arrangements, you may either pay a
          partial amount as chosen by the Tour Operator or pay in full. If you
          choose to pay a partial sum, the remainder of the amount should be
          paid within 3 days of paying the partial amount. Paying any of these
          amounts secures the specific types of airline tickets, tours, land
          transport etc, and this will be confirmed to you at time of booking.
          If we do not receive this balance in full and on time, we reserve the
          right to treat your booking as cancelled by you in which case the
          cancellation charges set out in clause 9 will become payable. We
          accept payment by credit card, debit card, internet banking and

          incorrect credit card information. We also reserve the right to do
          random checks in order to minimise credit card fraud. As a result of
          this, before issuing tickets we may require you to provide us with a
          fax or postal copy of proof of address, a copy of your credit card and
          a recent statement.

          If, after our confirmation invoice has been issued, you wish to change
          your travel arrangements in any way, we will do our utmost to make
          these changes, but it may not always be possible. Any request for
          changes to be made must be from the 'lead name' on the booking or your
          Tour Operator through TripBizz. You should be aware that these costs
          could increase the closer to the departure date that changes are made.
          Only one change of departure date, per booking may be permitted. Any
          change in departure date will be treated as a cancellation and full
          cancellation charges will apply. Note: Certain arrangements may not be
          amended after they have been confirmed and any alteration could incur
          a cancellation charge of up to 100% of that part of the arrangements.
          In some cases, any changes made may mean you having to pay for the
          cancelled arrangements and purchasing new ones at full cost.

        <div className="tandc-sub-header">If You Cancel Your Trip</div>
        <div className="tandc-sub-text">
          You, or any member of your party, may cancel your travel arrangements
          at any time. Written notification by mail, fax or email from the 'lead
          name' on the booking or your Tour Operator on your behalf, must be
          received at our offices. Note: if the reason for your cancellation is
          covered under the terms of your insurance policy, you may be able to
          reclaim these charges from your insurance company. Our cancellation
          charges are a percentage of the total trip cost. These charges are
          based on how many days before your departure we receive your
          cancellation notice and not when your correspondence was sent to us.
          Please note that any amendment charges are non-refundable. Please
          note, if only some members of your party cancel, in addition to
          incurring the applicable cancellation charges, we will recalculate the
          trip cost for the remaining travellers. You may have to pay the extra
          room charges such as single room supplements. In cases where
          cancellation charges made by our suppliers are higher than the cost of
          the deposit, we may pass the charge on to you. Please ask for full
          details and we will notify you of the specific charges applicable to
          your booking.

        <div className="tandc-sub-text">
          Our Tour Operators begin planning the arrangements we offer many days
          in advance and so we reserve the right to make changes to and correct
          errors in trip details both before and after bookings have been
          confirmed. We must also reserve the right to cancel confirmed bookings
          at any time. Most changes are minor but occasionally, we may have to
          make a Major Change. If we have to make a Major Change or cancel, we
          will tell you as soon as possible and if there is time to do so before
          departure, we will offer you the choice of the following options: (for
          Major Changes) accepting the changed arrangements or Purchasing
          alternative arrangements from us, of a similar standard to those
          originally booked if available (if the chosen alternative is less
          expensive than your original one, we will refund the difference but if
          it is more expensive, we will ask you to pay the difference) or
          Cancelling or accepting the cancellation in which case you will
          receive a full and quick refund of all monies you have paid to us. In
          such cases, TripBizz will refund the money that you had paid in full,
          without deducting any charges out of it.

          3-4 working days, but can take upto 21 working days to hit your
          accounts. Refund will be initiated ONLY to the original mode of
          payment. In cases where refund is not possible to original mode of
          payment, refund may be done to buyer's banking account, wherein we
          will need to do verification (KYC) and proof of ownership of account.
          The timeline of the verification can vary from 7-15 working days. All
          Paypal refunds, after 60 days of transaction, will be done ONLY to the
          Paypal linked E-mail ID (quickest mode) used to make initial payment.
          Exceptions will be handled from case to case basis, but we do not

          Any change in the identity of the carrier(s), flight timings, and/or

          1. In respect of Packages We promise that your Trip arrangements will
          be made, performed or provided with reasonable skill and care. This
          means that we will accept responsibility if, for example, your
          contracted arrangements are not provided as promised or prove
          deficient as a result of the failure of ourselves or our employees to
          use reasonable skill and care in making, performing or providing your
          arrangements. However, we shall not be responsible for any errors
          which occur due to any systematic issues or fluctuation in prices or
          availability of flights/hotels/car or our service providers. In such
          cases we would be able to provide you a full refund. 2. In respect of
          other arrangements We promise to use reasonable skill and care in the
          performance of our contractual obligations, subject to and in
          accordance with these Booking Conditions. Our contractual obligations
          consist of using our reasonable skill and care in making your booking
          and arranging your accommodation/car hire/ flight, as well as using
          our reasonable skill and care in choosing our suppliers. 3. In respect
          of Packages and other arrangements We will not be responsible for any
          injury, illness, death, loss, damage, expense, cost or other claim of

          omission(s) of the person(s) affected or any member(s) of their party
          or 2. The act(s) and/or omission(s) of a third party not connected
          with the provision of your arrangements and which were unforeseeable
          or unavoidable 3. Except as specifically set out in these conditions,
          we will not accept any further or different liability than the Package
          Travel, Package Tours and Package Trips Regulations impose. It is your
          responsibility to show that reasonable skill and care has not been
          used if you wish to make a claim against us. 4. Local
          Excursions/Activities/Events We will not accept responsibility for
          services or facilities which do not form part of our agreement or
          where they are not advertised in our website. For example any
          excursion you book whilst away, or any service or facility which your
          hotel or any other supplier agrees to provide for you. Excursions,
          tours, activities or other events that you may choose to book or pay
          for through anybody other than TripBizz or its Tour Operators or
          whilst you are on trip ("Local Events") are not part of your package
          trip provided by us and these website terms and conditions do not

          The fact that a special request has been noted on your confirmation
